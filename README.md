```

### ▶️ Running the App

Run the application with:

```bash
python perfectpixel/app.py
```

Or, on Windows, simply double-click the `start.bat` file if available.

The app will start on:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

### 🔍 How to Use

Open your browser and visit:

```
http://localhost:5000/compare?ref=https://example.com&test=https://staging.example.com
```

Replace the `ref` and `test` URLs with the pages you want to visually compare.

- The `ref` URL is the reference/original page.
- The `test` URL is the new or modified version.

You will see both pages overlaid with a slider to adjust transparency and scroll together.
